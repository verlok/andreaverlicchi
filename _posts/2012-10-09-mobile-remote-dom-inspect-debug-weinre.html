<p>If you are a front-end developer and make mobile websites / mobile web apps, you know that debugging on mobile devices is a pain.</p>
<p><img src="/assets/weinre_ready.png" alt="" title="Weinre Ready to Debug" width="710" height="325" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-174" /></p>
<p>Although you might not know that you can remotely inspect your mobile web app or website using <a title="Weinre website" href="http://people.apache.org/~pmuellr/weinre/docs/1.x/1.5.0/" target="_blank">Weinre</a>. Here's how:</p>
<p><!--more--></p>
<ol>
<li>Download and install <a title="Node.js website" href="http://nodejs.org/" target="_blank">Node.js</a></li>
<li>Install Weinre using the following command:
<pre>sudo npm install -g weinre</pre>
<p>on Windows, without "sudo"</li>
<li>Start Weinre with the following command:<br />
[code lang="bash"]weinre --boundHost={DEVELOPMENT_MACHINE_IP_ADDRESS}[/code]</p>
<p>Be sure to replace {IP_ADDRESS_DEL_SERVER} with the development machine IP address.<br />
This will allow your mobile device to remotely connect to your Weinre server.<br />
To start Weinre on a port other than 8080 (the default), use the following command:</p>
<p>[code lang="bash"]weinre --boundHost={DEVELOPMENT_MACHINE_IP_ADDRESS} --httpPort={ANY_PORT}[/code]</li>
<li>Point your browser to the address Weinre is listening on (i.g.: 192.168.178.1:8080).<br />
This will allow you to get the Target Script, that in this case would be:<br />
[code lang="javascript"]<br />
&lt;script type=&quot;text/javascript&quot; src=&quot;http://192.168.178.1:8080/target/target-script-min.js#anonymous&quot;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;<br />
[/code]</li>
<li>Copy and paste the Target Script from the browser to the page you want to debug (inside the head tag will be nice)</li>
<li>Click on the link "debug client user interface" (i.g.: http://192.168.178.1:8080/client/#anonymous)</li>
<li>On your mobile device, visit the site you want to debug</li>
</ol>
<p>Now, if you did everything correctly...</p>
<ol>
<li>In the browser window which is still pointing to the Weinre page (see previously at step 4), you will see a new target appear</li>
<li>Click on the link of the Target that you want to debug (then it'll become green)</li>
<li>Inspect using the Elements and Resources panels (unfortunately, the Network panel doesn't work on Weinre)</li>
</ol>
<p>Happy debugging!<br />
If you have issues, let  me know in the comments.</p>
