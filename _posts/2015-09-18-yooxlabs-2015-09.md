On Tuesday, 2015 September the 22nd the first [YOOXlabs tech event](http://techevents.yooxlabs.com/) took place in Bologna, Italy and I'll spoke about agile CSS development using SASS and Compass.

Here's the post about [advanced sprites generation using Compass (SASS)]({% post_url 2015-03-06-advanced-sprite-generation-using-compass-sass %}) that I mentioned during the talk.
