On March 17th 2017 I will speak about **responsive images, an HTML 5.1 standard** at the [CSS Day 2017 Conference](http://2017.cssday.it) in Faenza, Italy. The speech will be on web performance, because using responsive images is a way to serve lighter images to smaller screens (and viceversa).

I will also take a sneak peek on how to generate the right size for your images in the cloud using a software as a service.

Sounds interesting? See you [there](http://2017.cssday.it)! (and be sure to stay in Romagna for the week-end, the seaside is not so far, and I'm sure the weather will be just right)

Here are the slides of my talk, from my <a href="//www.slideshare.net/verlok">SlideShare</a>:

They are also available as video, where you can **watch the videos embedded in the presentation** and appreciate the animations.
