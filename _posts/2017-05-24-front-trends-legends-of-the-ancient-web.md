> The best time to have ideas is before you know what you’re doing. The early history of the Web is full of experiments and false starts that fizzled out, but might be worth trying again. There are also some lessons about what not to do that we failed to learn from the first time. At the very least, we can inject some life into the boring, corporate, centralized Web of 2017.
