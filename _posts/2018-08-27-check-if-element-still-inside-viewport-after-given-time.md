What would you do if they asked you to load a DOM element only if it **stays inside the viewport for a given time**? You would use [vanilla-lazyload](https://github.com/verlok/lazyload), wouldn't you? üòâ

This is exactly what a couple of GitHub users asked me to develop as new feature of LazyLoad, to avoid loading elements which users skipped **scrolling fast over them**. 

I want to share how I did it with you, because there are a couple of ways of doing this. The first one is checking the element's posistion over time, the second one is with IntersectionObserver.

## Without IntersectionObserver

This way is much slower that using `IntersectionObserver` because it implies:

- watching browser‚Äôs scroll and resize events to call a callback (ok, throttled, but still&hellip;)
- in the callback, loop though every watched element and call a `isInsideViewport` function to check if they are inside viewport 
- the `isInsideViewport` function checks a [bunch of things](https://github.com/verlok/lazyload/blob/support/8.x/src/lazyload.viewport.js) like the element's `getBoundingClientRect`, the window's `innerHeight`, `pageYOffset`, etc. and returns a boolean

All these checks only to know when elements enter the viewport.

To know if the elements stay inside the viewport for a given time, you should do something like:

- `setTimeout` a `isStillInsideViewport` function when the element enters the viewport
- in the `isStillInsideViewport` function, check if the element is still inside the viewport calling `isInsideViewport` on that element, then:
  - if it is, load it and remove it from the watched elements
  - if it's NOT, don't load it and keep watching it

Quite straightforward as a thought, but not that fast executing.

## The way with IntersectionObserver

This way is much faster because it only implies the following.

- you set an `IntersectionObserver` and use it to observe all your watched elements
- it calls a `onIntersection` function each time "an intersection" occurs
- you can do the loading logic inside the `onIntersection` function

No need to watch browser‚Äôs scroll and resize events.

### First idea

My first thought was to do like without `IntersectionObserver`, meaning to check the "is inside viewport" state after a timeout.

Turns out there is not an elegant way to check if an element is inside the viewport with intersection observer. You just get callbacks when an element intersects with the viewport.

### Discovering thresholds

But wait, what is that `IntersectionObserver`'s `thresholds` option in the [doc](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Intersection_Observer_API)? üò≤

Says MDN:

> Either a single number or an array of numbers which indicate at what percentage of the target's visibility the observer's callback should be executed. If you only want to detect when visibility passes the 50% mark, you can use a value of 0.5. If you want the callback run every time visibility passes another 25%, you would specify the array [0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1]. The default is 0 (meaning as soon as even one pixel is visible, the callback will be run). A value of 1.0 means that the threshold isn't considered passed until every pixel is visible.

After I fiddled around with the option and tried the result in a specific [delay load demo](https://github.com/verlok/lazyload/blob/master/demos/delay_test.html), I found out that explicitly passing `0` to the `thresholds` option (don't ask me why, it should be the default value), the `onIntersection` function is called also when the element _exits_ the viewport.

### Ultimate solution

Now that I can know when an element **exits the viewport**, it's **much easier to solve the main problem**.

The solution, ultimately, is to:

- `setTimeout` a function when an element enters the viewport
- store each timeout ID in a `data-` attribute of the related element
- make the element load when the timeout occurs
- if the element exits the viewport before the timeout is executed, cancel the timeout with `clearTimeout`

That linear and easy! üòä

## Show me the code!

You can find the full code in vanilla-lazyload's [`lazyload.js`](https://github.com/verlok/lazyload/blob/master/src/lazyload.js) file + related imports. If you don't feel like jumping from one file to another, you could also open the bundled file [`lazyload.es2015.js`](https://github.com/verlok/lazyload/blob/master/dist/lazyload.es2015.js) from the `dist` folder. 

A **simplified version** of the code is provided below for your convenience.

### Setting IntersectionObserver

```js
const myObserver = new IntersectionObserver(
    onIntersection,
    getObserverSettings({
        root: document,
        rootMargin: "300px",
        threshold: 0
    })
);
```

### onIntersection function

This function is called each time an intersection occurs, and the parameter is the set of entries that intersected with the viewport.

Say `watchedElements` are the elements being watched by the script. After each intersection they should be purged from the elements we already dealt with (loaded). 

The `purgeElements` function is out of the scope of this post, but it just returns a subset of the watchedElements.

```js
const onIntersection = function(entries) {
    entries.forEach(manageIntersection);
    // watchedElements = purgeElements(watchedElements);
},
```

### manageIntersection function

This function is called on each entry that intersected with the viewport. Both on enter and exit.

On enter, it starts the delayed loading of the element. On exit, it cancels it.

```js
const manageIntersection = function(entry) {
    var element = entry.target;
    if (isIntersecting(entry)) {
        delayLoad(element, delayTime);
    }

    if (!isIntersecting(entry)) {
        cancelDelayLoad(element);
    }
};
```


### isIntersecting utility function

This is a utility function to understand whether or not an entry is intersecting

- `entry.isIntersecting` needs fallback because it is `null` on some versions of MS Edge
- `entry.intersectionRatio` is not enough alone because it could be `0` on some intersecting elements 

```js
const isIntersecting = entry =>
    entry.isIntersecting || entry.intersectionRatio > 0;
```

### delayLoad function

This is the function that delays the load of the element by `delayTime`.

```js
const delayLoad = (element, delayTime) => {
	var timeoutId = getTimeoutData(element); // gets the timeout ID from a data-attribute
	if (timeoutId) {
		return; // do nothing if the timeout was already set
	}
	timeoutId = setTimeout(function() {
		loadAndUnobserve(element);
		cancelDelayLoad(element);
	}, delayTime);
	setTimeoutData(element, timeoutId); // sets the timeout ID in a data-attribute
};
```

### cancelDelayLoad function

This function's duty is to cancel the element timeout, if it's set.

```js
const cancelDelayLoad = element => {
	var timeoutId = getTimeoutData(element);
	if (!timeoutId) {
		return; // do nothing if timeout doesn't exist
	}
	clearTimeout(timeoutId);
	setTimeoutData(element, null);
};
```

### loadAndUnobserve function

This immediately loads the element, and takes it away from the `IntersectionObserver`'s observed elements.

```js
const loadAndUnobserve = (element) => {
	revealElement(element);
	myObserver.unobserve(element);
};
```

## Final words

I hope you enjoyed this article!

See how easy is to do check if an element is still inside the viewport after some time using `IntersectionObserver`?

Is there something you would have done differently, or do you agree with what I did here? Please let me know in the comments!
