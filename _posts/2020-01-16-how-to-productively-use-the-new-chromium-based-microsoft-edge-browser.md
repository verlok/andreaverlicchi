The new Chromium-based Microsoft edge browser is finally here! Hereâ€™s a practical guide on how you can use it productively from day one. TL;DR: Download it, change the default search engine, install extensions, also from the Chrome Web Store.

## Index

1. Download Microsoft Edge
2. Change the default search engine
3. Install extensions from Chrome web store
4. Optionally set the dark theme

## Download for any platform

No matter if you are on Windows or Mac OS, and if your Windows version is 10, 8 or 7, You can download the browser from this page: https://www.microsoftedge.com

## Change the default search engine

After you installed it, the first thing you want to do is to change your default search engine to Google or DuckDuck (unless you really like Bing). You can do that from the Settings panel, Privacy and Services tab.

- Click on the `...` button
- Select "Settings"
- Selecte "Privacy and services" in the left menu
- (scroll down to the bottom) 
- Click "Address bar"
- Select your favourite search engine from the "Search engine used in the address bar" drop down

Happy usage!

## Install extensions

Microsoft Edge has its own marketplace for extensions, but on Microsoft Edge you can also **install extensions from the Chrome web store**.

- [Extensions for Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/collections/edgeextensions/)
- [Extensions from the Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions)

When you visit the Chrome Web Store, Edge shows a blue bar on top telling you that you can install extensions from there. Just click the "Allow extensions from other stores" button and you're good to go.


## Set dark theme (optional)

If you like dark themes on development stuff like I do, you can activate the dark theme from the Settings panel, Appearance tab.

- Click on the `...` button
- Select "Settings"
- Select "Appearance"
- Select "Dark" from the "Theme" drop down

## More? Profiles

If you are a Chrome user, at your first usage of Microsoft Edge everything gets magically migrated from Chrome to Edge. At least, that's what happened to me when I started using Edge Dev some months ago.

You might be interested in creating one or more profile and sync options, so that when you use Edge on your other devices (PC, Other PC, Mac, etc.) you find your passwords, autofill options and browsing history at hand.

## Become an insider

You can also be an insider and use Microsoft Edge early releases. There are 3 of them: Beta, Dev and Canary. The most frequently updated one is Canary (updated every day), the less frequently updated is Beta (every month?), so it's more stable to use. The Dev version is updated every week.

I personally used Microsoft Edge Dev as my primary browser for months on both Mac and Windows for leisure and development purposes and I'm veeery satisfied. Unfortunately, the latest Dev and Canary versions have stopped working on one of my machines starting January 9th, but I already reported it to Microsoft and I expect a fix soon.
