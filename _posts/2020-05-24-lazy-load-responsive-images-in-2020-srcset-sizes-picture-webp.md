Do you want to boost performance on your website? You can do that by using **responsive images** and **lazy loading**! In this article you will find the **HTML, JavaScript and CSS code** to lazy load responsive images, to make browsers use **modern image formats** like **WebP** and **Jpeg2000**, and to enable **native lazy load** where supported.

## Definitions

**Responsive images** are images that adapt to your design by **downloading a different image source** from a given **set of image sources**, which you provide, depending on **some conditions**, which you specify. You can specify basic conditions related to the browser's **viewport width** and **device pixel density** using a regular `img` tag, and you can use media queries by wrapping your images in a `picture` tag. More about [responsive images in the MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Responsive_images).

**Lazy loading images** is a technique to make your website render faster by **deferring the loading of below-the-fold images** to when they **enter the viewport**. Beyond performance, this also allows you to save bandwidth and money, e.g. if you're paying a CDN service for your images.

## Above-the-fold first

Bear in mind that using a script to **lazy load images is a Javascript-based task** and it's **relevantly slower than the regular image loading** (_eager loading_ from now on) which starts as soon as the HTML document is being parsed.

‚òùÔ∏è For this reason, the best practice is to **eagerly load above-the-fold images**, and **lazy load only the below-the-fold images**.

A good way to understand how many images will appear _above-the-fold_ in your responsively designed page is... to count them! Open your page in a browser and **try it in the most common viewports** of smartphones, computers, and tablets.

## Now to some code!

Here's the HTML markup of an _eagerly loaded_ responsive image.

```html
<!-- Eagerly loaded responsive image -->
<!-- Only for above-the-fold images!!! -->
<img
  alt="Image 01"
  src="https://via.placeholder.com/220x280?text=Img+01"
  srcset="
    https://via.placeholder.com/220x280?text=Img+01 220w,
    https://via.placeholder.com/440x560?text=Img+01 440w
  "
  sizes="220px"
/>
```

And here's the markup you're going to need to _lazy load_ a responsive image.

```html
<!-- Lazy loaded responsive image -->
<!-- Only for below-the-fold images!!! -->
<img
  alt="Image 03"
  class="lazy"
  data-src="https://via.placeholder.com/220x280?text=Img+03"
  data-srcset="https://via.placeholder.com/220x280?text=Img+03 220w, 
    https://via.placeholder.com/440x560?text=Img+03 440w"
  data-sizes="220px"
/>
```

Want a low-resolution preview while your lazy images load? You can do that by using a small, low-quality image in the `src` tag, like the following.

```html
<!-- Lazy loaded responsive image + low-res preview -->
<!-- Only for below-the-fold images!!! -->
<img
  alt="Image 03"
  class="lazy"
  src="https://via.placeholder.com/11x14?text=Img+03"
  data-src="https://via.placeholder.com/220x280?text=Img+03"
  data-srcset="https://via.placeholder.com/220x280?text=Img+03 220w, 
    https://via.placeholder.com/440x560?text=Img+03 440w"
  data-sizes="220px"
/>
```

[Open the üëÄ demo](http://verlok.github.io/vanilla-lazyload/demos/image_srcset_lazy_sizes.html), then your browser's **developer tools**, and switch to the **Network panel**. You will see that the first 2 images are loaded _eagerly_ just after page landing, while the rest of the images are loaded _lazily_ **as you scroll down** the page.

We're using the `img` HTML tag and not the `picture` tag, given that the latter is not necessary in this case. I'll dig into the `picture` tag use cases [down below](#picture-tag-use-cases).

üí¨ _What about Internet Explorer?_

Internet Explorer does not support responsive images, but you don't need to use a polyfill because <abbr title="Internet Explorer">IE</abbr> reads and uses the image specified in the `src` attribute, so choose an image that will appear nice on a desktop, mDPI (not retina) display, put it in the `src` attribute, and you're good.

Besides, consider that Microsoft is silently replacing Internet Explorer with [Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/edge)), which is a modern browser.

### Script inclusion

To load the lazy images as they enter the viewport, you need a lazy load script such as [vanilla-lazyload](https://github.com/verlok/vanilla-lazyload) which is a lightweight (2.5 kb gzipped), blazing-fast, configurable, SEO-friendly script that I've been maintaining and improving since 2014.

Here is the simplest way to include it in your page.

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vanilla-lazyload@16.1.0/dist/lazyload.min.js"></script>
```

Other ways to include LazyLoad in your web pages, like using an `async` script with auto-init, using RequireJS, using WebPack or Rollup, are [documented here](https://github.com/verlok/vanilla-lazyload/#include-lazyload-in-your-project).

### LazyLoad initialization

You need LazyLoad to manage and load all the images with a `lazy` class included in the page. You can initialize `LazyLoad` like this:

```js
var lazyLoad = new LazyLoad({
  elements_selector: ".lazy"
  cancel_on_exit: true
  //‚òùÔ∏è recommended options
});
```

### Some CSS Tricks

There are also some features that you can achieve using CSS only. You might want to:

- **Make not-yet-loaded lazy images to occupy some space**. The main reason is to avoid collapsing your layout while your images are yet to be loaded.
- Avoid empty images to appear as broken images

You can do all that using these CSS rules:

```css
/*
Images container to occupy space 
when the images aren't loaded yet
*/
.image-wrapper {
  width: 100%;
  height: 0;
  padding-bottom: 150%;
  /* ‚òùÔ∏è image height / width * 100% */
  position: relative;
}
.image {
  position: absolute;
  /* ... */
}

/*
Avoid empty images to appear as broken
*/
img:not([src]):not([srcset]) {
  visibility: hidden;
}
```

## Picture tag use cases

Until now, I wrote about the `img` tag with the `srcset` and `sizes` attributes, which is the solution to the vast majority of the responsive images you might need and use on a website or web application. Now, in which cases should you use the `picture` tag?

### Different width/height ratio

Use case: you need to show images with different **width/height ratio** depending on a media query. e.g. you want to show _portrait_ images on mobile, vertical devices, _landscape_ on wider viewports, like tablets and computers.

Here's the code you're gonna need in this case. In order to have eagerly loaded images, just use the plain `src` and `srcset` attributes, without `data-` prefix.

```html
<picture>
  <source
    media="(min-width: 1024px)"
    data-srcset="https://via.placeholder.com/1024x576?text=Horizontal+Image 1x,
      https://via.placeholder.com/2048x1152?text=Horizontal+Image 2x"
  />
  <source
    media="(max-width: 1023px)"
    data-srcset="https://via.placeholder.com/640x960?text=Vertical+Image 1x,
      https://via.placeholder.com/1280x1920?text=Vertical+Image 2x"
  />
  <img
    class="lazy"
    alt="Stivaletti"
    data-src="https://via.placeholder.com/1024x576?text=Horizontal+Image"
  />
</picture>
```

[Open the üëÄ demo](http://verlok.github.io/vanilla-lazyload/demos/picture_media.html), then your browser's **developer tools** and switch to the **network panel**. You will see that it downloads only the image source corresponding to the first media query that matches.

### Load modern formats like WebP and Jpeg2000

Use case: you want browsers to choose the source to **load a modern format like WebP and Jpeg2000** depending on its support for that format.

You need the `source` tag and the `type` attribute containing the MIME type of the images in the `data-`/`srcset` attribute.

```html
<picture>
  <source
    type="image/jp2"
    data-srcset="https://via.placeholder.com/1024x576?text=Jpeg2000+Image 1x, 
      https://via.placeholder.com/2048x1152?text=Jpeg2000+Image 2x"
  />
  <source
    type="image/webp"
    data-srcset="https://via.placeholder.com/1024x576?text=WebP+Image 1x, 
      https://via.placeholder.com/2048x1152?text=WebP+Image 2x"
  />
  <img
    data-src="https://via.placeholder.com/256.jpg?text=1024x576+Jpg+Image"
    data-srcset="https://via.placeholder.com/1024x576?text=Jpg+Image 1x, 
      https://via.placeholder.com/2048x1152?text=Jpg+Image 2x"
    data-sizes="220px"
    alt="An image"
    class="lazy"
  />
</picture>
```

[Open the üëÄ demo](http://verlok.github.io/vanilla-lazyload/demos/picture_type_webp.html), then your browser's **developer tools** and switch to the **network panel**. You will see that it downloads only the image source corresponding to the first type that your browser supports.

## _One more thing_

The vanilla [LazyLoad script](https://github.com/verlok/vanilla-lazyload) leverages the IntersectionObserver API so, in browser not supporting it like Internet Explorer and older versions of Safari, it will load all images as soon as it executes, which leads more or less to the same result as if no LazyLoad was ever used on the page.

If you want to load your content lazily in the 100% of the browsers out there (I wouldn't, but it's up to you), you need to include the [IntersectionObserver Polyfill](https://github.com/w3c/IntersectionObserver/tree/master/polyfill) script before LazyLoad.

You can either you put the script in the page just before the LazyLoad one, as it follows...

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/intersection-observer@0.10.0/intersection-observer.js"></script>
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/vanilla-lazyload@16.1.0/dist/lazyload.min.js"></script>
```

...or you can load it the polyfill as a dependency of LazyLoad using _RequireJS_ or another AMD module loader. [More info here](https://github.com/verlok/vanilla-lazyload/blob/master/README.md#include-via-requirejs-without-intersectionobserver-polyfill).

## Conclusions

Here is a summary:

1. Don't load all the images lazily, just the ones _below the fold_
2. Use the `img` tag to do simple responsive images
3. Use the `picture` tag to conditinally serve the WebP version of your images, or to change your images ratio
4. Use [vanilla-lazyload](https://github.com/verlok/vanilla-lazyload/) to load your lazy images.
5. Optionally use the IntersectionObserver polyfill if you want to load lazily on 100% of the browsers.
