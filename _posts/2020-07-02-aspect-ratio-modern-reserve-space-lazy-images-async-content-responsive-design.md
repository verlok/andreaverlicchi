To avoid **layout shifting** and optimize for the [Cumulative Layout Shift](https://web.dev/cls/) [web vital](https://web.dev/vitals/) in you web pages, you need to reserve space for any **content that might be rendered later in time**. This is the case for images, videos and any asynchonously loaded content (e.g with AJAX calls). Here's a new way to do it.

<figure>
  <div class="post-image-spacer" style="background-color: #eee">
    <img alt="Boxes of different aspect ratios and the text: &quot;A modern way to reserve space for lazy images and async content in responsive design&quot;" src="/assets/post-images/aspect-ratio__2x.png" srcset="/assets/post-images/aspect-ratio__1x.png 1x, /assets/post-images/aspect-ratio__2x.png 2x" class="post-image">
  </div>
</figure>

## The good old way

The traditional way to reserve space for images is to use the vertical padding trick.

```html
<div class="image-wrapper">
  <img
    alt="An image"
    src="image.jpg"
  />
</div>
```

```css
.image-wrapper {
  width: 100%;
  height: 0;
  padding-bottom: 150%;
  /* ðŸ‘† image height / width * 100% */
  position: relative;
}
.image {
  width: 100%;
  height: auto;
  position: absolute;
}
```

## The modern way - implicit

The modern and simpler way is to define a width / height aspect ratio implicitly by [defining the width and height attributes on images and videos](https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/1276779799198007301).

```html
<img
  alt="An image"
  src="image.jpg"
  width="200"
  height="300"
/>

<video
  alt="A video"
  src="video.mp4"
  width="1600"
  height="900"
>
  ...
</video>
```

```css
/* Modern browser stylesheets will add a default
  aspect ratio based on the element's existing 
  width and height attributes */
  img, video {
    aspect-ratio: attr(width) / attr(height);
  }
```

Chromium browsers are already doing that. [Check out this pen](https://codepen.io/verlok/pen/ExPwzGO) and note how the paragraph is rendered below the images even before the images start loading.

Unfortunately this is not working for images lazy loaded using Javascript. See [this pen](https://codepen.io/verlok/pen/bGEYyZe) and see that the `width` and `height` attributes have no effect. This is probably because the `src`/`srcset` attributes are both missing.

 âš  `aspect-ratio` is not supported by Safari yet, but it will be [supported in Safari 14](https://twitter.com/jensimmons/status/1275171897244823553) later in 2020.

## The modern way - explicit

You can also explicitly set the aspect ratio in your CSS code using [the aspect-ratio CSS rule](https://twitter.com/una/status/1260980901934137345).

```html
<div
  class="async"
  bg="background__1x.jpg"
  bg-hidpi="background__2x.jpg"
>
  Content is loading...
</div>
```

```css
.async {
  aspect-ratio: 16/9;
}
```

âš  `aspect-ratio` is not supported by Safari yet, but it will be [supported in Safari 14](https://twitter.com/jensimmons/status/1275171897244823553) later in 2020.

## Conclusion

We will soon be able to ditch the vertical padding trick in favor of implicitly or explicitly setting the `aspect-ratio` CSS rule.
