I started coding on an [MSX Computer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX) when I was 9. So I studied informatics and I started working as a programmer at 19. Two years later I realized that I loved the web, and I started working as a web developer.

During my experience I worked as both back-end and front-end developer. I worked with Flash and HTML, with ASP and PHP, and literally fell in love with web semantics, accessibility and usability (which I still love).&nbsp;In the last few years I focused on front-end web development, so now I'm an expert CSS, HTML and Javascript coder.

In the last couple of years I also started managing small teams of coders.

I currently work at [Yoox Group](http://www.yooxgroup.com) as a front-end guide. I also run some projects of my own.

I love:

* nature, hiking and moving by bicycle
* healty, clean and fair food
* arts, all kinds of
* regional and foreign cultures and languages

I hate:

* <acronym title="Internet Explorer">IE</acronym> 6 ;) (and 7... and 8)
