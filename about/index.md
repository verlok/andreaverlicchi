I started coding on an [MSX Computer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX) when I was 9, then studied informatics, started working as a programmer at 19, realized that I loved the web and started working as a web developer at 21, specialized on the front-end at 29. Now I'm 36 and I work as **front-end architect** (or guide) at [Yoox Net-a-Porter Group](http://www.ynap.com).

Today I'm mainly focused on front-end so **HTML**, **CSS**, **Javascript**, **usability**, **SEO**, semantic markup, accessibility. Less recently I worked also as back-end developer using PHP (which I still use for my pet projects), and of course I was a Flash programmer.

Besides work I love **nature**, **cycling**, **hiking**, healty & tasty food (especially home-made food), and all kinds of regional and foreign languages and cultures.
