Hello, I'm Andrea, and I've been a programmer for 30 years (wow, that's long). 

To be honest, when I started coding on my [MSX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX) when I was 9, I just copied the programs from a magazine, but I was loving it. Not long later, thanks to my father's patience and a programming manual for kids with a robot-dog, I learned how to code on my own. 

So I decided to study informatics at school and at 19 I started working as a software developer. But it was the end of the 90's, the internet was exploding, [Flash](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) was ruling, and I fell in love again with the web. At 21 I started working as a web developer and I specialized on the front-end at 29 (now I'm 39). 

Currently, I work as **front-end architect** at [YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP](http://www.ynap.com). My job is really focused on the front-end, and I take care of **performance optimization**, research and development, training, accessibility. Less recently I worked also as back-end developer using PHP (which I still use for my pet projects), and of course I had been a Flash programmer.

Besides work I love **nature**, **cycling**, **hiking**, healty & tasty food (especially home-made food), and all kinds of regional and foreign languages and cultures.
