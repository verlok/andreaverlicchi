Recently I've been counting and I realized I'm a programmer for 30 years. That's long. To be honest, when at 9 I started coding on my [MSX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX), I just copied lines of code from a magazine, but I was loving it. Not long later, thanks to my father's patience and a programming manual for kids featuring a robot-dog, I learned how to code on my own. 

So I decided to study computer science at school and at 19 I started working as a software developer. But it was the end of the 90's, the internet was exploding, [Flash](https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adobe_Flash) was ruling, so I fell in love again, this time with the web. At 21 I started working as a web developer and I specialized on the front-end at 29 (currently I'm 39). 

Nowadays, I've been working as a **front-end architect** at [YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP](http://www.ynap.com) for 5 years. My job is really focused on **performance optimization**, research and development, training, accessibility.

Less recently I worked also as back-end developer using PHP (which I still use for my pet projects), and of course in the past I was a Flash programmer.

Besides work I love nature in all of its forms, cycling, hiking, healthy local food (wherever I go), and all kinds of regional and foreign languages and cultures, and above all my family and my kid Lorenzo.
