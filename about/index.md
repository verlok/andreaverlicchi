Hello, I'm Andrea, and this is my face.

I've been working as a **front-end architect** at [YOOX NET-A-PORTER GROUP](http://www.ynap.com) since 2013. My job is really focused on **performance optimization**, research and development, accessibility, internal training and tech assessment for  recruiting.

Less recently I worked also as back-end developer using PHP (which I still use for my pet projects) and other object-oriented languages. 

Besides work I love nature in all of its forms, cycling, hiking, healthy local food (wherever I go), and all kinds of regional and foreign languages and cultures, and above all my family and my kid Lorenzo.

PS: recently I've been counting and I realized I'm a programmer for 30 years. To be honest, when at 9 I started coding on my [MSX](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MSX), I just copied lines of code from a magazine, but I was loving it. Anyway I have to say thanks to my father for his patience, and the company that included a programming manual for kids (featuring a robot-dog!) in their computers box, because that's how I started to code.
