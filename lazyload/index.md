You might be here because of an old link, since I've recently changed the URL of the vanilla-lazyload website. You're visiting the old URL, the new one is this &rarr; [vanilla-lazyload website](/vanilla-lazyload)

Oh, didn't you know that I'm the author of a LazyLoad script? It's very popular. You can find it on:

- [GitHub](https://github.com/verlok/vanilla-lazyload)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vanilla-lazyload)
- [jsdelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/vanilla-lazyload)
- [on this website](/vanilla-lazyload)

If you really like it, you can show your ‚ù§ appreciation by [buying me a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/verlok).
